# Welcome to the AutoGentoo configuration file
# If this file was generated by the gui then it is probably best not to mess with it unless you know what your doing
# In this file there are 3 type of variable types that will be automatically detected by AutoGentoo,
# they are listed below with there IDs:
# 0: normal, has a name and a value
# 1: argument, has a name and arguments
# 2: list, just has a name

[mounts]
# The following partitions will be mounted to their corresponding directory
# Only /boot and / required for installtion of Linux
# Formating partitions can go in the [format] section
# Arguments work as follows:
# arg0: path to device
# arg1: file system type
# arg2: mount options
# Remember to enable 'discard' for SSDs to enable TRIM
/boot=/dev/sda1 ext2 defaults
/=/dev/sda5 ext4 defaults,noatime
/usr=/dev/sda6 ext4 defaults,noatime
/var=/dev/sda7 ext4 defaults,noatime
/home=/dev/sda8 ext4 defaults,noatime

[format]
# The following partitions will be formated
# Arguments work as follows:
# arg0: file system type
# arg1 and on: extra formating options
# For partitions mounted to '/var' and '/usr' it is recommended to use '-T small' for small inodes
# I would just do that for all of them
# Also it is recommended to enable journaling with -j (doesn't work on ext2 devices) so that you don't need to manually fix broken inodes
# This step is not required but recommended, AutoGentoo GUI will probably have already formated your devices
# If you want to disable this step

[user]
# This section will give information about the user that will be added
# The 'fullname' is the name of the user
# The 'name' is the username that the system will identify the user by
# The 'password' has a MD5 encryption so don't worry
# The 'groups' is a list of groups
