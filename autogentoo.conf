# Welcome to the AutoGentoo configuration file

# For slashes in variable names use underscores

[mounts]
# The following partitions will be mounted to their corresponding directory
# Only /boot and / required for installtion of Linux
# Formating partitions can go in the [format] section
# Arguments work as follows:
# arg0: path to device
# arg1: file system type
# arg2: mount options
# Remember to enable 'discard' for SSDs to enable TRIM
_boot=/dev/sda1 ext2 defaults
_=/dev/sda5 ext4 defaults,noatime
_usr=/dev/sda6 ext4 defaults,noatime
_var=/dev/sda7 ext4 defaults,noatime
_home=/dev/sda8 ext4 defaults,noatime

[format]
# The following partitions will be formated
# Arguments work as follows:
# arg0: file system type
# arg1 and on: extra formating options
# For partitions mounted to '/var' and '/usr' it is recommended to use '-T small' for small inodes
# I would just do that for all of them
# Also it is recommended to enable journaling with -j (doesn't work on ext2 devices) so that you don't need to manually fix broken inodes
# This step is not required but recommended, AutoGentoo GUI will probably have already formated your devices
# If you want to disable this step
